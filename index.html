            <p>Typically, a florist will organize flowers by season and holiday. Flowers have various different meanings
                in
                different cultures. The holidays and events for which flowers are used vary. Poppies are used to
                remember
                fallen
                soldiers only in Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries.[2] People often prefer flowers that are
                associated with their ethnic group or country and the cultural meaning of the flower color strongly
                affects
                their choice and use. Colors convey different meanings to different groups so that, for example, various
                colors
                may be associated with luck or death or love. A flower such as a red rose might communicate love in some
                cultures, whereas in others, it might be considered indecent or simply puzzling. The vastly divergent
                attitudes
                to the color white can also lead to miscommunication and sometimes give offense. White, for example,
                represents
                death in many Asian cultures, whereas white is usually a symbol of purity and innocence in countries
                with a
                European heritage.[3] Early Victorians, among others, developed an entire, comprehensive language of
                flowers
                sometimes referenced in the floral industry today.</p>
